Artificial Intelligence (AI), the ability of a computer or digital controlled robot to perform tasks usually associated with smart objects. The term is frequently applied to a project to develop systems conferred on humans' distinct intellectual processes, such as the ability to think, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experiences. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to perform very complex tasks - for example, discovering proof of mathematical theories or playing chess - with great skill.However, despite the continuous progress in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human resilience across broader domains or in tasks that require a lot of daily knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have achieved the levels of performance of human experts and professionals in performing specific specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in various applications such as medical diagnostics, computer search engines, voice or handwriting

    <td>Reactive machines are the most basic type of AI system. This means that they cannot form memories or use past experiences to influence present-made decisions; they can only react to currently existing situations – hence “reactive.” An existing form of a reactive machine is Deep Blue, a chess-playing supercomputer created by IBM in the mid-1980s.Reactive machines have no concept of the world and therefore cannot function beyond the simple tasks for which they are programmed. A characteristic of reactive machines is that no matter the time or place, these machines will always behave the way they were programmed. There is no growth with reactive machines, only stagnation in recurring actions and behaviors.</td>
    <td>Limited memory is comprised of machine learning models that derive knowledge from previously-learned information, stored data, or events. Unlike reactive machines, limited memory learns from the past by observing actions or data fed to them in order to build experiential knowledgeAlthough limited memory              builds on observational data in conjunction with pre-programmed data the machines already contain, these sample pieces of information are fleeting. An existing form of limited memory is autonomous vehicles..</td>
    <td>What constitutes theory of mind is decision-making ability equal to the extent of a human mind, but by machines. While there are some machines that currently exhibit humanlike capabilities (voice assistants, for instance), none are fully capable of holding conversations relative to human standards. One component of human conversation is having emotional capacity, or sounding and behaving like a person would in standard conventions of conversation.Some elements of theory of mind AI currently exist or have existed in the recent past. Two notable examples are the robots Kismet and Sophia, created in 2000 and 2016, respectively.</td>

<h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence:</h2>

<h3>Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare:</h3> Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known technologies is IBM’s Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. AI is a study realized to emulate human intelligence into computer technology that could assist both, the doctor and the patients in the following ways:
By providing a laboratory for the examination, representation and cataloguing medical information
By devising novel tool to support decision making and research
By integrating activities in medical, software and cognitive sciences
By offering a content rich discipline for the future scientific medical communities.
<h3>Artificial Intelligence in business:</h3> Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM (Customer relationship management) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have already been incorporated into websites and e companies to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT consultancies.
<h3>AI in education:</h3> It automates grading, giving educators more time. It can also assess students and adapt to their needs, helping them work at their own pace.
<h3>AI in Autonomous vehicles:</h3> Just like humans, self-driving cars need to have sensors to understand the world around them and a brain to collect, processes and choose specific actions based on information gathered. Autonomous vehicles are with advanced tool to gather information, including long range radar, cameras, and LIDAR. Each of the technologies are used in different capacities and each collects different information. This information is useless, unless it is processed and some form of information is taken based on the gathered information. This is where artificial intelligence comes into play and can be compared to human brain. AI has several applications for these vehicles and among them the more immediate ones are as follows:
Directing the car to gas station or recharge station when it is running low on fuel.
Adjust the trips directions based on known traffic conditions to find the quickest route.
Incorporate speech recognition for advanced communication with passengers.
Natural language interfaces and virtual assistance technologies.
<h3>AI for robotics</h3> It will allow us to address the challenges in taking care of an aging population and allow much longer independence. It will drastically reduce, may be even bring down traffic accidents and deaths, as well as enable disaster response for dangerous situations for example the nuclear meltdown at the fukushima power plant.
